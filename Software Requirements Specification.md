### 2. Overall Description & System Architecture

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The application is a client-server system.
* **Client:** A self-contained, client-side web application that operates entirely within the user's browser, responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
* **Server:** A Node.js backend application responsible for the core business logic, including playlist generation, database communication with MySQL, and secure proxying of requests to the LLM API.

#### 2.2 Design and Implementation Constraints

**UI-C1: Styling and Technology**
* The user interface must be styled using the Bootstrap 5 framework and custom CSS3 to achieve a modern glassmorphism aesthetic with professional appearance.
* The application must implement comprehensive glassmorphism design principles including animated gradient backgrounds, backdrop blur effects, and semi-transparent layered elements.

**UI-C1.1: Glassmorphism Design Requirements**
* Animated gradient background using white, gray, and silver color transitions with CSS keyframe animations for elegant, professional appearance
* Backdrop filter blur effects (minimum 10px) applied to all primary containers and cards for frosted glass aesthetic
* Semi-transparent backgrounds using rgba() color values for layered depth with white/gray/silver color scheme
* Enhanced text readability through strategic text shadows and high contrast colors optimized for accessibility
* Interactive elements with glass-like hover effects and subtle transformations maintaining professional elegance
* Smooth color transitions between white (#ffffff), light gray (#f8f9fa), medium gray (#e9ecef), and silver (#ced4da) tones

**UI-C2: Layout and Responsiveness**
* The main application container must be configured to occupy 98% of the browser's viewport width.
* The primary layout must be a two-column design with specific relative widths for desktop views:
    * The Left Column (Control Panel) must occupy 45% of the container's width.
    * The Right Column (Results Panel) must occupy 55% of the container's width.
* The application must be fully responsive. On smaller screens, the two columns should stack vertically.

**DEV-C1: Code Modularity**
* The application logic in both the client-side `script.js` and the Node.js backend must be architected in a modular fashion. Functionality should be broken down into well-named, single-responsibility functions.

**DEV-C2: Project File Structure**
* The project must be composed of the following files:
    * **Frontend:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `songs.js`, `prarthanais.js`, `functions.js`, `members.js`
    * **Backend:** `server.js` (or similar entry point), `package.json`, `.env`
    * **Documentation:** `Software Requirements Specification.md`, `README.md`, `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**DEV-C3: Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
* A strict separation between structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) must be enforced.
    * **HTML (`index.html`):** Must be used exclusively for defining the semantic structure of the web page.
    * **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Must be used exclusively for client-side logic (UI updates, event handling, API calls to the backend). It must not contain hardcoded HTML markup strings.
    * **CSS (`style.css`):** Must be used exclusively for defining presentation and layout.
    * **Node.js (Backend):** Must contain all business logic, database interactions, and communication with external services (LLM).

**DEV-C4: Configuration and Security Management**
* Sensitive information, including the LLM API Key and MySQL database credentials, **must not** be stored in the client-side code.
* All sensitive keys and configuration values must be stored on the server-side as **environment variables** (e.g., in a `.env` file that is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`). The Node.js application will load these variables at runtime.

**DATA-C1: Data Sources**
* The `songs.js` file is the definitive, immutable source of truth for all song data. This file is not to be modified by the running application.
* The `prarthanais.js` file contains prayer/devotional text data with unique IDs and full Tamil text content for playlist headers.
* The `functions.js` file contains a comprehensive list of 31 Tamil festival and ceremonial functions/occasions for event categorization.
* The `members.js` file contains the complete member database with contact details, addresses, and phone numbers for 22 bhajan group members.
* The MySQL database is the definitive source for playlist history. It will be read from and written to by the Node.js backend.

**DATA-C3: Event Data Structure**
* Bhajan details must support dual time fields: `startTime` and `endTime` for comprehensive event scheduling
* Time range display shall format as "Start Time - End Time" when both times are provided
* Application state must maintain separate fields for start and end times to support flexible event planning

**DATA-C2: Data Integrity**
* The `duration` field in `songs.js` is stored as a "minutes.seconds" string (e.g., "5.17"). The backend logic must parse this string into a numerical format (total seconds) for any duration calculations.
* The application logic must be robust enough to handle potentially inconsistent or empty values in the `songs.js` data.
