### **Software Requirements Specification: Thirupugazh Song List Generator**
**Version:** 2.8
**Date:** January 29, 2025

---
### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the Thirupugazh Song List Generator. The application's primary objective is to automate the creation of structured, timed playlists for bhajan sessions by adhering to a specific 16-step thematic sequence, thereby saving significant manual preparation time for organizers.

#### 1.2 Scope
The system will consist of a client-side web application and a server-side Node.js backend. The web interface will allow a user to generate a playlist of a specified duration. The backend will house a rule-based engine to construct the playlist according to the strict sequence, manage a persistent history of generated songs in a MySQL database to avoid repetition, and securely interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) for post-generation modifications. The scope includes comprehensive song search functionality, PDF export, keyboard shortcuts, and robust error handling.

#### 1.3 Recent Updates (Version 2.8)
* **Alankaaram Functionality:** Added comprehensive Alankaaram support with checkbox selection and customizable time duration (default 4 minutes, range 1-30 minutes) for enhanced playlist customization.
* **PDF Layout Enhancement:** Changed PDF orientation to landscape mode with increased font sizes (14px body, 12px table cells, 24px title) for optimal readability on various devices.
* **Alankaaram PDF Display:** PDF export now includes Alankaaram column showing tickmarks (✓) and time durations for songs with Alankaaram enabled, providing complete playlist information.
* **Table Structure Update:** Enhanced playlist table with 6 columns including the new Alankaaram column, with optimized column widths for landscape layout.

#### 1.4 Previous Updates (Version 2.7)
* **PDF Readability Enhancement:** Improved PDF font sizes from 9px to 12px body text and 8px to 10px table cells for better accessibility, especially for older users. Removed 1-page restriction, allowing up to 2 A4 pages for optimal readability.
* **Enhanced PDF Margins:** Increased margins from 0.3in to 0.5in and improved spacing for better visual comfort and reading experience.
* **Zero Zoom Factor:** Removed aggressive 0.85 zoom factor compression, now using 1.0 for natural text sizing and improved legibility.

#### 1.4 Previous Updates (Version 2.6)
* **Album Hierarchy Correction:** Fixed பொதுப் பாடல்கள் (Pothu Paadalgal) positioning from end of sequence to Step 6 (after Five Abodes, before Pancha Bhoota) as per original SRS requirements.
* **Enhanced 16-Step Sequence:** Extended from 13-step to 16-step sequence by adding three new compulsory albums after வகுப்பு: பூஜோபசாரங்கள், ஏறுமயில், and ப்ரார்த்தனை.
* **Missing Album Assignment Fix:** Corrected album assignments for ஏறுமயில் and ப்ரார்த்தனை songs in songs.js database.
* **PDF Layout Optimization:** Implemented readable A4 formatting with appropriately sized fonts for accessibility, allowing up to 2 pages for better readability, especially for older users.

This ensures adequate representation of general devotional songs while maintaining the existing time-filling logic for additional songs beyond the minimum requirement.

#### 1.7 Previous Updates (Version 2.2)
* **Enhanced AI Chatbot Interface:** Upgraded from single-line text input to multi-line textarea for improved user experience with complex commands.
* **AI Assistant Commands Guide:** Added comprehensive user guidance including available commands, examples, and behavioral explanations.
* **UI Reorganization:** Streamlined interface by consolidating action buttons (Export PDF, Clear Playlist) below the Generate Playlist button, removing the separate Quick Actions card.
* **Enhanced User Feedback:** Improved messaging system to clearly explain song repositioning behavior according to the 16-step hierarchy.
* **Album-Specific Documentation:** Added specific explanations for special cases like கந்தர் அனுபூதி album containing only one comprehensive song.
* **Replace Functionality Clarification:** Enhanced user understanding of replace operations and automatic song repositioning.

#### 1.8 Previous Updates (Version 2.1)
* **Pancha Bhoota Sthalam Implementation:** Clarified and implemented the identification logic for Pancha Bhoota Sthalam albums.

---
### 2. Overall Description & System Architecture

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The application is a client-server system.
* **Client:** A self-contained, client-side web application that operates entirely within the user's browser, responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
* **Server:** A Node.js backend application responsible for the core business logic, including playlist generation, database communication with MySQL, and secure proxying of requests to the LLM API.

#### 2.2 Design and Implementation Constraints

**UI-C1: Styling and Technology**
* The user interface must be styled using the Bootstrap 5 framework and custom CSS3 to achieve a clean, modern, and professional appearance.

**UI-C2: Layout and Responsiveness**
* The main application container must be configured to occupy 98% of the browser's viewport width.
* The primary layout must be a two-column design with specific relative widths for desktop views:
    * The Left Column (Control Panel) must occupy 45% of the container's width.
    * The Right Column (Results Panel) must occupy 55% of the container's width.
* The application must be fully responsive. On smaller screens, the two columns should stack vertically.

**DEV-C1: Code Modularity**
* The application logic in both the client-side `script.js` and the Node.js backend must be architected in a modular fashion. Functionality should be broken down into well-named, single-responsibility functions.

**DEV-C2: Project File Structure**
* The project must be composed of the following files:
    * **Frontend:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `songs.js`
    * **Backend:** `server.js` (or similar entry point), `package.json`, `.env`

**DEV-C3: Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
* A strict separation between structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) must be enforced.
    * **HTML (`index.html`):** Must be used exclusively for defining the semantic structure of the web page.
    * **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Must be used exclusively for client-side logic (UI updates, event handling, API calls to the backend). It must not contain hardcoded HTML markup strings.
    * **CSS (`style.css`):** Must be used exclusively for defining presentation and layout.
    * **Node.js (Backend):** Must contain all business logic, database interactions, and communication with external services (LLM).

**DEV-C4: Configuration and Security Management**
* Sensitive information, including the LLM API Key and MySQL database credentials, **must not** be stored in the client-side code.
* All sensitive keys and configuration values must be stored on the server-side as **environment variables** (e.g., in a `.env` file that is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`). The Node.js application will load these variables at runtime.

**DATA-C1: Data Sources**
* The `songs.js` file is the definitive, immutable source of truth for all song data. This file is not to be modified by the running application.
* The MySQL database is the definitive source for playlist history. It will be read from and written to by the Node.js backend.

**DATA-C2: Data Integrity**
* The `duration` field in `songs.js` is stored as a "minutes.seconds" string (e.g., "5.17"). The backend logic must parse this string into a numerical format (total seconds) for any duration calculations.
* The application logic must be robust enough to handle potentially inconsistent or empty values in the `songs.js` data.
